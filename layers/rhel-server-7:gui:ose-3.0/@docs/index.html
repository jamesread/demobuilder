<title>OpenShift 3.0.2 base image</title>

<xmp style="display:none;">
## Description

This image provides a base instance of OpenShift 3.0.2, including the
master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  All S2I builder
images are also included, but Internet connectivity is required to run.

This image includes builder images and is vanilla, so is handy for SAs and
consultants to replicate issues / experiment with the product with Internet
connectivity.

Run the VM and open the GUI.  Log in as *demo* and set your password.

## Getting started

#### Browse the OpenShift web user interface

1. Double-click the *Firefox Web Browser* icon on the desktop.  The OpenShift
   web user interface will open on the login page.
1. Enter your username (`demo`) and the password that you set at login time, and
   click *Log In*.
1. Click a project workspace (e.g. *demo*).

#### Create an application hosted on OpenShift

WARNING: currently you will need your VM to be connected to the Internet for
this step to succeed.

1. Follow the steps above.
1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Click the example URL of a Git source code repository,
   `https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex`, to populate the *Repository URL*
   box and click *Next*.
1. Click the *nodejs* builder image.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Middle-click the application URL
   (*http://nodejs-ex.demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a new
   tab.

#### Use the OpenShift ("oc") command line tool

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `oc login` and press Enter to login to OpenShift.
1. Enter your username (`demo`) and press Enter.

1. Type `sudo -i` and press Enter to change to the root user.
1. Type oc commands such as `oc status` and `oc get pods` as appropriate.
