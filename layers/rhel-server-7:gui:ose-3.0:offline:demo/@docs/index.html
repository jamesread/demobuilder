<title>OpenShift 3.0.2 offline image with demo</title>

<xmp style="display:none;">
## Description

This image provides an all-in-one instance of OpenShift 3.0.2, including the
master and node components, examples, GUI and web browser.  All S2I builder
images are also included, and source code and dependencies for all examples
apps is pre-downloaded, so no nothing extra is needed and the image can be
run disconnected from the internet.  This image also includes all the
components necessary for an OpenShift 3.0.2 demo.

This image is heavily modified and additionally includes JBoss Developer
Studio.  It is intended for SAs in order to demo the full OpenShift end-user
experience.

Run the VM and open the GUI.  Log in as *demo* and set your password.

## OpenShift walk-through

Follow in order the steps below to walk through some basic capabilities of
OpenShift.

#### Browse the OpenShift web user interface

1. Double-click the *Firefox Web Browser* icon on the desktop.  The OpenShift
   web user interface will open on the login page.
1. Enter your username (`demo`) and the password that you set at login time, and
   click *Log In*.
1. Click a project workspace (e.g. *demo*).

#### Create an application hosted on OpenShift from source code

These steps demonstrate how to import a simple application into OpenShift from a
git source tree, and have OpenShift build and deploy the application.  The steps
demonstrate how easy it is to get started with OpenShift.

1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Click the example URL of a Git source code repository,
   `git://openshift.example.com/github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex`, to populate the
   *Repository URL* box and click *Next*.
1. Click the *nodejs* builder image.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Middle-click the application URL
   (*http://nodejs-ex.demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a new
   tab.

#### Create an application hosted on OpenShift from a pre-defined template

These steps demonstrate how OpenShift can build and deploy a (possibly
multi-component) traditional or modern application from a pre-defined template.
This might be done by a developer, tester or operator to quickly set up a
dedicated application instance according to its template, using OpenShift's
self-service portal.

1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Under *Instant Apps*, click *monster*.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Middle-click the application URL
   (*http://monster.demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a new
   tab.

#### Commit a source code change to an application hosted on OpenShift

These steps demonstrate how a developer could make changes to their application
source code and quickly see those changes replicated in their own application
instance running on OpenShift.

1. Make a small change to the source code.
   1. Double-click the *Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 8.1.0.GA* icon on the
      desktop.
   1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to open the Open Resource window, and type
      `home.html` to select
      *monster/src/main/webapp/resources/templates/desktop/home.html*.  Click
      *Open*.
   1. Make a sample change to the text which is visible on the Ticket Monster
      home page, then click *File/Save*.
1. Commit and push the source code.
   1. Click the *Link with Editor* button in the *Project* window to find
      *home.html* in the *Project* window.
   1. Right-click *home.html*, and select *Team/Commit...*.
   1. Enter a git commit message (e.g. "minor change"), ensure
      *src/main/webapp/resources/templates/desktop/home.html* is ticked, then
      click *Commit and Push*.
   1. A message should be shown including the text "Triggering OSE3 build...".
      Click *OK*.
1. See the change in the application.
   1. Return to Firefox.  OpenShift will clone, built and deploy a new version
      of the Ticket Monster application.  It should not take long.
   1. Middle-click the application URL
      (*http://monster.demo.apps.example.com*), and the change you made should
      be visible in OpenShift.

#### Debug an application hosted on OpenShift

These steps demonstrate how a developer could debug the source code of an
application running on OpenShift from their IDE.

1. Set a breakpoint.
   1. Return to JBoss Developer Studio.
   1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to open the Open Resource window, and type
      `BookingService.java` to select
      *monster/src/main/java/org/jboss/examples/ticketmonster/rest/BookingService.java*.
      Click *Open*.
   1. Scroll down to line 124, `public Response createBooking...`.  Right-click
      in the blue bar to the left of the text and select *Toggle Breakpoint* to
      set a breakpoint on the function.
1. Connect to the application debugger port.
   1. Now double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
   1. Type `oc login` and press Enter to login to OpenShift.
   1. Enter your username (`demo`) and press Enter.
   1. Enter the password that you set at login time and press Enter.
   1. Type `oc get pods` and find the name of the pod hosting the Ticket monster
      application.  It will be of the form `monster-2-{randomid}` and will be in
      state `Running`.
   1. Port-forward the pod's debugger port locally.  Type `oc port-forward -p
      monster-2-{randomid} 8787`.
1. Start debugging.
   1. Return to JBoss Developer Studio.
   1. Click *Run/Debug Configurations...*.
   1. Double-click *Remote Java Application* in the list on the left.
   1. Change the port number on the right from `8000` to `8787` and click
      *Debug*.
1. Trigger the breakpoint.
   1. Return to Firefox and the Ticket Monster application.
   1. Follow the application to buy a ticket.
   1. When you click *Checkout*, the breakpoint will be triggered.  You will be
      taken back to JBoss Developer Studio, and it will ask to open the Debug
      perspective.  Click *Yes*.
1. Examine the state of the application.
   1. In the *Variables* window at the top right of the screen, you will be able
      to see details of the booking you just entered.
   1. Expand the variable *bookingRequest* and right-click *email*.  Select
      *Change Value...* to change the application state in OpenShift.
   1. Enter a different value in the box, and click *OK*.
   1. Click *Run/Resume* to resume flow of the application.
   1. Return to Firefox and click *Bookings*.  You should see that you
      successfully modified the e-mail address of your booking through the
      debugger.

#### Rollback an application component

These steps demonstrate how a developer or operator could rollback an unwanted
change to an application component running on OpenShift.

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `oc rollback monster-1` and press Enter.
1. Return to Firefox and wait for OpenShift to rollback the application.
1. Navigate to the application front page, and press `CTRL + SHIFT + R` to
   refresh it.  In due course you should find that the change you made earlier
   has been reverted.

#### Scale an application component

These steps demonstrate how an operator could manually scale up or down the
number of instances of an application component running on OpenShift.

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `oc scale --replicas=2 dc monster` and press Enter.
1. Return to Firefox.  You should see that there are now two Ticket Monster
   pods.

#### Reset the demo project

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `oc delete all --all` to reset your project.
1. Type `exit` to close the terminal window.

#### Use the OpenShift ("oc") command line tool as the system:admin user

1. Double-click the Terminal icon on the desktop.
1. Type `sudo -i` and press Enter to change to the root user.
1. Type oc commands such as `oc status` and `oc get pods` as appropriate.
1. Type `logout` to change back to the demo user.
1. Type `exit` to close the terminal window.
